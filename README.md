This project was showcased at a Hackathon organized by the Computer Society of India at Vidyalankar Institute of Technology. The challenge was to develop a practical attendance system suitable for use during the pandemic. Given the circumstances, a contactless system utilizing facial recognition is the best option. This project highlights the potential of such a system and also takes into account the ability to recognize faces while masks are being worn.
